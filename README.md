### Implementation VGG-16 ,VGG-19  from the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf)

## Requirement
* Opencv3
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* python3

##### The Model weight for [VGG16](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models/releases/download/v0.1/vgg16_weights_th_dim_ordering_th_kernels.h5) [VGG19](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models/releases/download/v0.1/vgg19_weights_th_dim_ordering_th_kernels.h5) can be downloaded and saved in the weight folder

##### Few Notes about  paper
	*scaling is not done on input image but  mean value is subtracted
	*Input image is 244*244 in the Network
